## Docker & SQL
1. Install Docker
2. run `docker run hello-world` to test if docker is installed correctly. You should see `Hello from Docker!` & a new hello-world image was downloaded
3. Create the `Dockerfile` for the Docker Image. The image is for python to run (the pipeline)
4. Use `docker-compose.yaml` to create multiple images for the PostgreSQL database with pgAdmin. Run `docker-compose up` to start
